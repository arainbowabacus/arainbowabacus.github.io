<h1>Welcome to Jess' GitHub page</h1>
  <p>As I learn new techniques, solve problems and explore different technologies I hope to use this site to showcase my efforts.</p>
  
<h2>Completed puzzles</h2>
  <p>Here you can view a mixture of puzzles which I have worked on. These tend to be short, standalone tasks. I have completed these using a range of different languages.</p>

<h2>Codecademy Puzzles and Projects</h2>
    <p>Puzzles in this section are mainly code with little accompanying description and were completed as part of courses on the Codecademy platform.
    I have added them here to document the early parts of my coding journey.</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/arainbowabacus/Aubergine/blob/master/CAprojectone.py">Project 1 - Creating a basic checkout function with Python</a><br>

  <h2>Project Euler Solution</h2>
    <p>Puzzles in this section are taken from Prohject Euler.</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li> 1: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
           The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of the all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.<br>

      <li> 2. Even Fibonachi - Each new term in the fib sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms by starting with one and two the first ten 
           terms will be1,2,3,5, 8 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 etc. By considereing terms in the f seqence whos values do need exceed 4 million find the sum of the even valued terms
